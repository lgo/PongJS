[PongJS][pjs] (click here to check it out!)
======
PongJS is a quickly hacked up HTML5+Javascript pong game. It was made over the span of an hour to showcase the power of basic programming to fellow peers in highschool during clubs day. This showcase was designed to show the ability and ease of programming, along with the flexability of programming. This was done by changing simple parameters throughout the clubs day which had extreme but fun effects on gameplay, such as pong ball size and speed and the paddle size and speed.
